# Landmark-Classification-Algorithm-using-CNN

This project defines and trains a CNN on a dataset of world-wide landmark images. A customized landmark image dataset is used for training. A data pipeline consisting of data transformation and data loaders is created. A CNN is created, trained, and validated on this dataset. The optimized CNN yields an accuracy of 64% on test data. Separately, ResNet152 model is customized by partial training on this dataset. The optimized ResNet152 model yields an accuracy of 77% on test data.
